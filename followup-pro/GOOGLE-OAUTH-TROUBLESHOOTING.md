# üîß Google OAuth Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Current Issue: Account Selection Works, But Login Fails

If you can see the Google account selection screen but login fails after selecting an account, here's how to fix it:

## üîç Step 1: Check Browser Console for Errors

1. **Open Developer Tools**
   - Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect"
   - Go to the **Console** tab

2. **Try to sign in with Google**
   - Click "Continue with Google"
   - Select your account
   - When it fails, check the console for error messages

3. **Look for these common errors:**
   ```
   Error: redirect_uri_mismatch
   Error: invalid_client
   Error: OAuth provider not configured
   ```

## üîß Step 2: Verify Redirect URI Configuration

### In Google Cloud Console:

1. **Go to your OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
   - Google Cloud Console ‚Üí APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
   - Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID

2. **Check Authorized Redirect URIs**
   - Make sure you have EXACTLY these URLs:
   ```
   https://vfoazaxtdqgjyqrwbsoy.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:5174/auth/callback
   ```

3. **Common Issues:**
   - Missing `https://` or `http://`
   - Wrong project ID in the URL
   - Extra spaces or characters
   - Missing `/auth/v1/callback` path

### In Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Check your project URL**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Copy your Project URL (starts with `https://`)

2. **Verify Google Provider Settings**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí Providers
   - Click on "Google" to expand
   - Make sure it's enabled
   - Check that Client ID and Secret are correct

## üîß Step 3: Test with Correct Redirect URI

### For Development (localhost):

1. **Update Google Cloud Console**
   - Add this exact redirect URI:
   ```
   http://localhost:5174/auth/callback
   ```

2. **Update Supabase Settings**
   - Go to Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
   - Set Site URL to: `http://localhost:5174`
   - Set Redirect URLs to include: `http://localhost:5174/auth/callback`

### For Production:

1. **Update Google Cloud Console**
   - Add your production domain:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback
   ```

2. **Update Supabase Settings**
   - Set Site URL to your production domain
   - Add production redirect URLs

## üîß Step 4: Check Supabase Logs

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Select your project
   - Go to Logs

2. **Look for Authentication Errors**
   - Filter by "Authentication" or "Error"
   - Look for Google OAuth related errors

3. **Common Error Messages:**
   ```
   "OAuth provider not configured"
   "Invalid redirect URI"
   "Client ID not found"
   ```

## üîß Step 5: Verify OAuth Scopes

1. **Check Default Scopes**
   - Google OAuth should request these scopes by default:
   ```
   openid
   email
   profile
   ```

2. **If Custom Scopes Are Set**
   - Make sure they include at least `email` and `profile`
   - Remove any unnecessary scopes that might cause issues

## üîß Step 6: Test with Fresh Browser Session

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear cookies and cache for your domain
   - Or use an incognito/private window

2. **Try Again**
   - Go to your app
   - Try Google sign-in again

## üîß Step 7: Check Network Tab

1. **Open Developer Tools**
   - Go to Network tab
   - Try Google sign-in

2. **Look for Failed Requests**
   - Look for requests to Google or Supabase that failed
   - Check the response status codes
   - Look for error messages in responses

## üö® Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Redirect URI Mismatch
```
Error: redirect_uri_mismatch
```
**Fix:** Make sure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console exactly matches what Supabase expects.

### Solution 2: OAuth Provider Not Configured
```
Error: OAuth provider not configured
```
**Fix:** Enable Google provider in Supabase and add correct Client ID/Secret.

### Solution 3: Invalid Client
```
Error: invalid_client
```
**Fix:** Check that Client ID and Secret are correct in Supabase settings.

### Solution 4: CORS Issues
```
Error: CORS policy blocked
```
**Fix:** Make sure your domain is properly configured in both Google and Supabase.

## üîç Debug Checklist

- [ ] Browser console checked for errors
- [ ] Redirect URIs match exactly
- [ ] Supabase Google provider enabled
- [ ] Client ID and Secret are correct
- [ ] Supabase logs checked for errors
- [ ] Fresh browser session tested
- [ ] Network requests examined
- [ ] OAuth scopes are correct

## üìû Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Share the exact error message** from browser console
2. **Share the Supabase log entries** (without sensitive data)
3. **Confirm your redirect URIs** are exactly as shown above
4. **Check if you're using the correct Supabase project**

## üéØ Quick Test

Try this quick test to isolate the issue:

1. **Create a simple test page** with just Google sign-in
2. **Use the same OAuth credentials**
3. **Test if it works there**

If it works on the test page but not in your app, the issue is in your app configuration, not the OAuth setup.

Most Google OAuth issues are related to redirect URI configuration. Double-check those URLs! üîç
