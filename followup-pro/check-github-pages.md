# GitHub Pages Configuration Check

## 🔍 Why Your GitHub Pages Version Was Blank

The issue was caused by:
1. **Incorrect base path** - Vite needs to know the repository name for asset paths
2. **Missing routing support** - React apps need special handling for client-side routing
3. **Missing 404.html** - Required for proper routing on GitHub Pages

## ✅ What I Fixed

1. **Updated `vite.config.js`**:
   - Added correct base path: `/FollowUpPro/`
   - Added build configuration

2. **Added routing support**:
   - Created `public/404.html` for GitHub Pages routing
   - Added routing script to `index.html`

3. **Updated title and metadata**

## 🚀 Your Site Should Now Work

Your GitHub Pages site should be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/FollowUpPro/`

## 📋 GitHub Pages Configuration Checklist

Make sure your GitHub repository has:

- [ ] **GitHub Pages enabled**:
  1. Go to your repository on GitHub
  2. Click "Settings"
  3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
  4. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
  5. Branch: "gh-pages"
  6. Click "Save"

- [ ] **Repository is public** (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)

- [ ] **gh-pages branch exists** (created by `npm run deploy`)

## 🔧 If It's Still Not Working

1. **Check the URL**: Make sure you're visiting the correct URL
   - Should be: `https://yourusername.github.io/FollowUpPro/`
   - Not: `https://yourusername.github.io/`

2. **Wait a few minutes**: GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update

3. **Check browser console**: Press F12 and look for errors

4. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

## 🎯 Alternative: Use a Custom Domain

If you want a cleaner URL, you can:
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `followuppro.com`)
2. Add it to GitHub Pages settings
3. Update the base path in `vite.config.js`
